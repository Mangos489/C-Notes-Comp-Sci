/*What are pointers?*/
/*Pointers are variables that can be assigned and refrence a memory address. 
*/

/* 
 On the topic of pointers here is an example of what pointers are ment to do. 
"Q: Where do you live?

A: At <street name>, <number>, <city>.

That's a pointer. Now, at that address, there is a building with many floors.

Q: On what floor do you live?

A: Floor X.

That's a pointer. Now, at that address, there are many apartments.

Q: What's your apartment's number?

A: It's Y.

That's a pointer.

A program manipulates data. That data is stored somewhere in memory. To access that memory we need a reference to it, that's what variables are. But sometimes, we need to manipulate the location of the memory itself.

That's what pointers do, they are variables that contain the location information. Just like Amazon will ask for your house address so that it can deliver your package, you don't send your house to Amazon, only its location information.

An index in an array is a pointer. An offset on the stack is a pointer. A virtual 64-bits address is a pointer. etc. */








char name[] = "Hello I am Jimmy.";
/* Char defines the array as characters.
   name is the assigned name to the array
   [] is the assigned value or character limit within the array.*/
